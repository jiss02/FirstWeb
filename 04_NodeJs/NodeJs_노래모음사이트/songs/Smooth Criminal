As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday - what a black day
Mouth to mouth
Resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats - intimidation
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?
(Then you
Ran into the bedroom)
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom)
(You've been struck by
A smooth criminal)
Okay, I want everybody to clear
The area right now!
Aaow!
(Annie are you ok?)
I don't know!
(Will you tell us that you're ok?)
I don't know!
(There's a sign in the window)
I don't know!
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
I don't know!
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know!
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know why baby!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom - Annie!)
Dag gone it - baby!
(Will you tell us that you're ok?)
Dag gone it - baby!
(There's a sign in the window)
Dag gone it - baby!
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
Hoo! Hoo!
(He came into your apartment)
Dag gone it!
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
Dag gone it!
