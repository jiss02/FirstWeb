          As he came into the window
          It was the sound of a crescendo
          He came into her apartment
          He left the bloodstains on the carpet
          She ran underneath the table
          He could see she was unable
          So she ran into the bedroom
          She was struck down, it was her doom
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok
          Are you ok, Annie
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok
          Are you ok, Annie
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok?
          Are you ok, Annie?
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok?
          Are you ok, Annie?
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok?
          Are you ok, Annie?
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok?
          Are you ok, Annie?
          You've been hit by
          You've been hit by
          A smooth criminal
          So they came into the outway
          It was Sunday - what a black day
          Mouth to mouth
          Resuscitation
          Sounding heartbeats - intimidation
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok
          Are you ok, Annie
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok
          Are you ok, Annie
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok?
          Are you ok, Annie?
          Annie, are you ok?
          So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?
          (Then you
          Ran into the bedroom)
          (You were struck down)
          (It was your doom)
          (You've been struck by
          A smooth criminal)
          Okay, I want everybody to clear
          The area right now!
          Aaow!
          (Annie are you ok?)
          I don't know!
          (Will you tell us that you're ok?)
          I don't know!
          (There's a sign in the window)
          I don't know!
          (That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
          I don't know!
          (He came into your apartment)
          I don't know!
          (Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
          I don't know why baby!
          (Then you ran into the bedroom)
          I don't know
          (You were struck down)
          (It was your doom - Annie!)
          Dag gone it - baby!
          (Will you tell us that you're ok?)
          Dag gone it - baby!
          (There's a sign in the window)
          Dag gone it - baby!
          (That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
          Hoo! Hoo!
          (He came into your apartment)
          Dag gone it!
          (Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
          Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
          (Then you ran into the bedroom)
          Dag gone it!
